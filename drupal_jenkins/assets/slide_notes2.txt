Jenkins 101: From a Drupal Perspective
//chef in list of tools
//graph showing server: chef, web, jenkins
//1000 productions sites

//before getting into the gui explain that we are going to be looking 

//execution code and config are save in xml and can be conversion controlled



1. Disclaimer //remove disclaimer and go straight to definitions
- Get the conversation started!
	- initiate a conversation 
	- improve efficiency, effectiveness, and reliability in processes 
	- easy to access output and notifications
- Do-ocracy
	- Create a panel
	- encourage participation
	- choose a role or task and jump in



2. What are the issues? //Why use Jenkins //Emphasize drupal crontab //expand beyond cron //remove cron
- none



3. What can be done?
- none



4. What is Drush?
- shell-based
- Learn it now!!!
- Reference learning resources



5. What is Jenkins? //need more here. Consider moving tool definition for jenkins up. emphasize it aggragates the rulst so you can evaluate in deeper detail. Possible go into installation. How involved is it? Can a noob do it? could be considered a script management system that provides feedback for analysis. anything that could be done on command line could be done on jenkins on a schedule. Jenkins can ssh into your box and run those commands. Leave big technical, add to in short and break into bullet points
- Dumb butler



6. Plan
- drush for cron jobs 
	- core-cron
		- alias: cron
	- run specific jobs with drush commands
- Jenkins
	- specify drush commands to run
	- notifications
	- track builds




7. Assumptions //no slide, but talk about it
- jenkins setup
- jenkins connected to server
- no details ///jenkins is a standalone server



8. Drush Command //emphasize different jobs and lead into this is cc all job. jobs: scrubbing the database, backing up and manipulating (data processing) the db. database dumps. clear cache (may not want to give site admins ability to clear cache). 
- none
//in this example we are calling into a machine with chef. we are calling 



9. Jenkins Dashboard
- job list
- click new job to start a new one



10. Create a Jenkins job
- name
- freestyle software



11. Configure
- Discard old builds and set max build. Jenkins will eventually die if you do not.
- point out buil history, we will go to most recent after config



12. Configure 2
- git integration
- trigger from another job



13. Configure 3
- bash code



14. Build
- none



15. Build Output
- something went wrong with permissions
- user who ran
- view code
	- success!



16. Recognize the Connection
- recognize the job name from the trigger in config


Next Steps - remove panel reference. duplicating efforts. anyone using jenkins?
start a collaborative discussion....
